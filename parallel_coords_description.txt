We chose to use Parallel Coordinates for this visualization because it allows us to explore multivariate relationships across several environmental and social factors simultaneously. This method is particularly effective for identifying potential patterns among different types of haunted events.

The Overall Parallel Coordinates visualization is based on a random sample of 3000 rows from the full dataset. This sampling approach helps reduce visual clutter while still preserving the general distribution of data. In contrast, the Real Haunted Places Parallel Coordinates only includes rows that are associated with detailed entries from the dedicated supernatural enthusiast website. These records are considered more credible and are used to highlight patterns within verified haunted locations.

For Overall Parallel Coordinates, we observe that most events tend to occur in regions with moderate alcohol abuse rates (14%–22%), daylight hours between 11–13, and temperatures ranging from 5°C to 30°C. The witness count is heavily skewed toward 0–3 people, with a notable peak at 5. However, the presence of outliers, such as extremely high precipitation levels or unusually high witness counts, indicates the inclusion of potentially unreliable data.

In the Real Haunted Places Parallel Coordinates, the data is noticeably cleaner and more concentrated. Most events are recorded in moderate climates, with temperatures typically between 5°C and 25°C, daylight around 11.5 hours, and low precipitation (<15mm). The witness count in this subset rarely exceeds 3, and extreme values in both temperature and rainfall are significantly reduced. This indicates that verified haunting reports are more likely to occur in stable, temperate conditions and are less prone to exaggeration.
