This line chart illustrates the yearly trends of reported supernatural sightings from 1700 to the present, categorized into Ghost, Orb, UFO/UAP, and Unknown types. While ghost sightings consistently dominate in frequency, all categories show a noticeable increase starting from the 20th century. This rise is likely influenced by improved record-keeping (Internet), media exposure, and growing public interest in the supernatural. The synchronized upward trends across different categories may suggest shared social or cultural drivers rather than isolated phenomena.

Compared to the Original Version, the Scaled Version magnifies the fluctuation patterns of non-Ghost events, making them easier to observe. In the Original Version, Ghost-related events show extreme outliers around 1800, 1900, and etc. mainly due to a parsing limitation where dates with only a known century are defaulted to the year ending in "00". As with other visualizations in this project, entries with the placeholder date "2025-01-01" have been excluded.
