To better understand the geographic distribution of haunted events and whether there is a spatial correlation between the occurrence time, we chose to visualize our data using a Bubble Map. Bubble Maps allow for intuitive comparison of spatial concentration and volume, making them an ideal choice for detecting patterns across regions. The first Bubble Map shown is based on the original coordinates provided in the dataset, while the second Bubble Map utilizes coordinates extracted by GeoTopic Parser, which analyzes textual content in the description column. By comparing the two maps, we aim to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of GeoTopic Parser in identifying geographic locations from unstructured text.

Map 1 reveals a dense clustering of haunted events primarily in the eastern half of the United States, particularly concentrated in the Midwest and Southeast regions. This suggests that certain areas may have a higher reporting frequency or cultural sensitivity toward supernatural occurrences. In terms of temporal distribution, the majority of events appear to occur at night, indicated by the dominance of orange bubbles over blue ones. This aligns with common perceptions of hauntings being more frequently reported during nighttime. From the map, there appears to be no strong regional bias regarding whether events happen during the day or night—the nighttime trend is generally consistent across all geographic regions.

Compared to Map 1, the coordinates generated by the GeoTopic Parser show noticeable deviations in point placement and density. Many locations do not align with the high-density areas observed in the dataset's original coordinates. This supports the findings in our Assignment 2 Report, where we concluded that the GeoTopic Parser’s extracted coordinates are less accurate and may introduce noise when used without manual validation.
