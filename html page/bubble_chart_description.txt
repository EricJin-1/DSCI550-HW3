This bubble chart visualizes the most frequently detected keywords from the “Detected objects” column, which are derived from objects identified in generated images using the Tika Caption function. Larger bubbles represent higher frequencies, while smaller ones indicate lower occurrences. During preprocessing, synonymous terms—such as “church” and “church building”—were consolidated under a unified label, like “church.” Additionally, rows containing unknown objects or objects occurring fewer than 100 times were automatically excluded to improve readability.

This visualization reinforces the conclusions drawn in our previous two reports, indicating that sites such as schools, churches, and locations commonly perceived as historically significant, narratively rich, or exhibiting low nighttime human activity are statistically more likely to be associated with reported hauntings.
