This heatmap visualizes reported sightings of haunted events from the 1700s to the 2020s, based on our earlier findings extracted directly from the “description” column and supplemented by keyword searches online. Note that we have excluded the default placeholder date of January 1, 2025, to improve the clarity of this visualization.

This visualization aims to uncover patterns between specific time periods and haunted events. In particular, we seek to determine whether certain years or seasons are more prone to paranormal activity than others.

In the “Original Heatmap,” March appears to be the most haunted month. However, this spike is due to the date parser automatically assigning the current month, March, to entries with unknown dates. To address this issue, we reset all March counts to zero and created the “Scaled Heatmap.”

In the “Scaled Heatmap,” most sightings appear to cluster between the 2000s and 2020s. Notably, there were 78 haunted events recorded in June 2020. However, this does not necessarily reflect the actual occurrence time of these events. Instead, it is likely the time when enthusiasts published these haunted events on platforms like Wikipedia.
Lastly, we decided to further exclude data from the 2000s to 2020s to see if clearer patterns could emerge in the “Scaled Heatmap 2.” This time, we observed notably more haunted sightings from the 1860s to the 2000s compared to earlier periods. We believe this is because, prior to the 1860s, there was a lack of standardized record-keeping and limited means of information dissemination.

In terms of months, we found that haunted sightings occurred more frequently in April, June, July, August, October, November, and December. This pattern can be explained by the influence of major events: April coincides with April Fool’s Day, June through August covers the summer holiday period when outdoor activities are more frequent, October is associated with Halloween, and November and December include major holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas, during which gatherings and travel increase the likelihood of reported paranormal experiences.
